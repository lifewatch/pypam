# Pypam

## Description

The goal of *pypam* is to allow easy reading and processing
of acoustic underwater data. *pypam* further depends on
[pyhydrophone](https://github.com/lifewatch/pyhydrophone) for hydrophone
metadata management and calibration.

*pypam* facilitates processing of audio files resulting from
underwater acoustic deployments. It enables application of existing
methods of acoustic data processing, and it allows the processing of
several deployments with one line of code, so it is easy to create
datasets to work with. *pypam* is oriented to extracting
features that can be used for machine learning algorithms or to the
extraction of broad acoustic information in time-series.
