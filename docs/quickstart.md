# Introduction to *pypam*

## Concepts

The idea of *pypam* is to process all the acoustic data resulting from an
underwater acoustic deployment. For a deployment, we understand a single
instrument from the moment it gets into the water until the moment it is
taken out. This data is usually stored in different files (and folders),
and sometimes has to be zipped because of lack of storage space. Don\'t
panic, you can still work with zipped folders directly from *pypam*
without having to unzip the whole project. Usually these files have a
continuity in time, and very often it is interesting to extract time
series.

*pypam* allows to choose a time window (currently named binsize) for processing, both for DataSet, and ASA. 
The selected binsize which will be the time resolution of the computed output. Then each feature will be
computed on that time window (independently of the file duration and sampling frequency). 
The output is an xarray dataset. The dimensions of these arrays are always:

- *id*: id of the bin (increasing integer)

extra coordinates (metadata)

- *datetime*: bin start timestamp of the \"time window\"
- *start_sample*: start sample of the bin respect to the file
- *end_sample*: end sample of the bin respect to the file
- *id\_*: id with respect to the file (changes when multiple files per
  deployment)

Frequency dependent features 
- *frequency*: center frequency of the band 
- *frequency_bins* (only for hybrid millidecade bands): center frequency of joined bands
- *upper_frequency*: upper limit of the frequency band
- *lower_frequency*: lower limit of the frequency band

## General workflow

First, we need to define our metadata by defining the hydrophone used,
using [pyhydrophone](<https://github.com/lifewatch/pyhydrophone>).
Check the docs of pyhydrophone to know the specific parameters needed
for your hydrophone. An example would be as follows:

    import pyhydrophone as pyhy

    # SoundTrap
    model = 'SoundTrap 300 STD'
    name = 'SoundTrap'
    serial_number = 67416073
    soundtrap = pyhy.soundtrap.SoundTrap(name=name, model=model, serial_number=serial_number)

Then, we need to process either a Signal, AcuFile or ASA:

## Acoustic File (acoustic_file.AcuFile)

To create or process an acoustic file, you can run:

    from pypam import acoustic_file

    acu_file = acoustic_file.AcuFile('tests/test_data/67416073.210610033655.wav', soundtrap, 1)
    acu_file.plot_power_spectrum()

    nfft = 8000  # Set to the same as sampling rate (or higher band limit, when downsampling) for 1s time resolution
    acu_file.hybrid_millidecade_bands(nfft=nfft, fft_overlap=0.5, binsize=None, bin_overlap=0, db=True,
                                                   method='density', band=None)

## Acoustic Survey (acoustic_survey.ASA)

For example, to obtain several features on a certain binsize, at three
different frequency bands:

    from pypam import acoustic_survey

    # Analysis parameters
    features = ['rms', 'sel', 'peak', 'aci']
    band_list = [[10, 100], [500, 1000], [500, 100000]]
    binsize = 60.0

    asa = acoustic_survey.ASA(hydrophone=soundtrap, folder_path='/tests/test_data', binsize=binsize)
    features_ds = asa.evolution_multiple(method_list=features, band_list=band_list)

Another example would be to obtain the third octave bands:

    from pypam import acoustic_survey

    # Analysis parameters
    binsize = 60.0
    third_octaves = None  # Calculate third octaves for the entire freq range

    asa = acoustic_survey.ASA(hydrophone=soundtrap, folder_path='/tests/test_data', binsize=binsize)
    oct_ds = asa.evolution_freq_dom('third_octaves_levels', band=third_octaves, db=True)

### Save the output

Finally, the output can be saved as a netCDF file. The output should
contain all the metadata necessary to reproduce the results, such as all
the metadata passed to the functions.

The saved files can afterward be loaded in *pypam* to produce plots.:

    oct_ds.to_netcdf('path_to_the_file.nc')

## Acoustic Dataset (dataset.Dataset)

Alternatively, we can process several deployments at once using the
Dataset class. To create an acoustic dataset made out of several
deployments (with different metadata), first it is necessary to create a
csv file where each row is a deployment. You can find an example in
docs/data_summary_example.csv. There is also a test file in
tests/test_data/data_summary.csv. This metadata information will be at
one point linked with the download output of ETN Underwater Acoustics
(<https://www.lifewatch.be/etn/>), but now the csv has to be manually
created.

So far, all the fields up to dc_subtract (see example) have to be
present in the csv file (even if they are left blank). If some extra
metadata should be added per deployment, then columns can be added (in
the example, etn_id, instrument_depth and method).

A Dataset is a conjunction of AcousticSurveys to be studied together.
The output is always in a structured folder.

``` none
üìÅ output_folder
‚îî‚îÄ üìÅ deployments/: contains one netcdf file per deployment processed
‚îî‚îÄ üìÅ detections/: contains the output of the detectors (if applicable)
‚îî‚îÄ üìÅ img/: contains graphs created (if applicable)
    ‚îú‚îÄ üìÅ data_overview/: general plots
    ‚îú‚îÄ üìÅ features_analysis/: stats from the features
    ‚îú‚îÄ üìÅ temporal_features/: graphs in time domain of the features
    ‚îî‚îÄ üìÅ spatial_features/: spatial plots (in a map) of the features
```

To create a dataset, run:

    import pathlib

    import pyhydrophone as pyhy
    import pypam

    # Acoustic Data
    summary_path = pathlib.Path('./data_summary_example.csv')
    include_dirs = False

    # Output folder
    output_folder = summary_path.parent.joinpath('data_exploration')

    # Hydrophone Setup
    # If Vpp is 2.0 then it means the wav is -1 to 1 directly related to V
    model = 'ST300HF'
    name = 'SoundTrap'
    serial_number = 67416073
    soundtrap = pyhy.soundtrap.SoundTrap(name=name, model=model, serial_number=serial_number)

    bk_model = 'Nexus'
    bk_name = 'B&K'
    preamp_gain = -170
    bk_Vpp = 2.0
    bk = pyhy.BruelKjaer(name=bk_name, model=bk_model, preamp_gain=preamp_gain, Vpp=bk_Vpp, serial_number=1,
                         type_signal='ref')

    upam_model = 'uPam'
    upam_name = 'Seiche'
    upam_serial_number = 'SM7213'
    upam_sensitivity = -196.0
    upam_preamp_gain = 0.0
    upam_Vpp = 20.0
    upam = pyhy.uPam(name=upam_name, model=upam_name, serial_number=upam_serial_number, sensitivity=upam_sensitivity,
                     preamp_gain=upam_preamp_gain, Vpp=upam_Vpp)


    instruments = {'SoundTrap': soundtrap, 'uPam': upam, 'B&K': bk}

    # SURVEY PARAMETERS
    nfft = 4096
    fft_overlap = 0.5
    binsize = 60.0
    bin_overlap = 0.0
    overlap = 0.5
    dc_subtract = False
    band_lf = [50, 500]
    band_list = [band_lf]
    temporal_features = ['rms', 'sel', 'aci']
    frequency_features = ['third_octaves_levels']

    # Create the dataset object
    ds = pypam.dataset.DataSet(summary_path, output_folder, instruments, temporal_features=temporal_features,
                               frequency_features=frequency_features, bands_list=band_list, binsize=binsize,
                               bin_overlap=bin_overlap, nfft=nfft, fft_overlap=fft_overlap, dc_subtract=dc_subtract)

    # Call the dataset creation. Will create the files in the corresponding folder
    ds()

## To produce plots

There are functions to plot compute and plot in one-go, such as:

    h_db = 1
    percentiles = [1, 10, 50, 90, 95]
    min_val = 60
    max_val = 140

    # ASA defined before
    asa.plot_spd(db=True, h=h_db, percentiles=percentiles, min_val=min_val, max_val=max_val)

But there is also the module plots, which allows to pass the saved
*.nc files to produce plots.
